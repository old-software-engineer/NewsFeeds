## Concepts

- DeepLinking: Deep Linking is a technique in which a given URL or resource is used to open a specific page or screen on mobile
- Promise/Promise.all: The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. The Promise.all() method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise.

## Linting and Formatting
- ESLint: It is a linter that you can integrate into your Visual Studio Code setup in order to ensure code integrity.
